I'm an MSc student in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

My academic interests:

🤖 Machine Learning

🔎 Information Retrieval

🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

📊 Data analysis and data-driven systems

🧠 Applied AI

Outside of tech, I enjoy watching films and playing videogames.
My favourite movie is The Matrix — probably one of the reasons why I'm studying AI.

I also love cats 🐱 and boxing 🥊 (which I practice).
No correlation between the two.
